// Constants - when we dont want to value of a variable to change

// an error is given to the console because we are trying to assign a new value to a constant 
const interestRate = .3;
//interestRate = 1; This will throw an error.
console.log(interestRate);

//If you need to reassign a value to a variable use "let", if not, use "const"
let interestRate2 = 1;
console.log(interestRate2);
