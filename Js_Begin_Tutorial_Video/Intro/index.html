<!-- You can add javascrip element to the head or body of a page-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<h1> This is a webpage </h1>

<body>


<p>I want to go to <strong>MEXICO</strong> </p> 

<script src="index.js"></script>
<!--Best practice is to put to script at the end of the body section after all other scripting elements-->
<!--Usually don't put in in the header because browser reads script from top to bottom. If script
is in the top, it'll take longer to load/render the page. Will make a bad UX-->
<!--Also, script will usually need to talk to page elements so is dependent on it being present
There may be exceptions if you're using third party code that has to get in the head section-->
